  <p>I am a Carroll Community College student who will be pursuing a
    degree in computer programming. I have learned multiple programming
   languages, and I generally take one computer class each semester. When I learn a
 new programming language, I enhance the skills I learned in previous classes. </p>

    <p>This past summer, we went to Iceland, and saw many waterfalls. The waterfall in this
     image is in a national park that we stopped at a few days into the trip. The waterfalls were both wide and narrow.</p>

  <p>When we were in Husavik, a town in Northern Iceland, we went on a whale watching boat tour,
     and the boat we rode on is in the picture.</p>
